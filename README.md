# Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-MVA

This repository contains the projects for the MVA's Probabilistic Graphical Models Class ( Bach / Obozinsky).

We did the projects in a team of two, composed by: Othmane Sayem and myself (Pirashanth RATNAMOGAN)

HW1: Some theoritical questions about MLE + Implementation of Logisitc Regression, Probabilistic Linear Regression, QDA model, and LDA model

HW2: Some theoritical questions about Graphical Models + Implementation of Gaussian Mixtures and KMeans

HW3: Some theoritical questions and implementation of HMM/ Viterbi decoding

Paper review: Deep boltzmann machines Salakhutdinov
